# Husksheets Microsoft Excel Clone

This project was created in a group of 5. This code above is mostly just the frontend code for which I authored (all .tsx files and some .ts)

### Features

Ability to save, delete, create, and edit spreadsheets, where changes are saved in a MongoDB database. 

Spreadsheets support basic cell functions, including SUM, MIN, MAX, etc... of the format =SUM($A1:$A5), where the cell with this function would display the sum of cells A1 to A5. This also supports nested functions. 

All files have over 95% test coverage
